title: "Reproducible Finance - Returns"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the code examples in the "Returns" chapter in _Reproducible Finance_. While the code in there covers a few different methods for getting the data, the plan here is to focus on the online methods for pulling the data and skip the code around things like importing XLS files.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
